## Dataset

The project is about the analysis and vizualisation of the bike_sharing system FordGoBike dataset in February 2019 used in SanFrancisco   
The dataset contains information about the duration of the trip ,the user(biker) information and information about the station

The dataset came in a csv file with over 180000 entries and 16 columns.

In the **Wrangling step** ,there was 8265 missing data in the birth year ang gender observation that i decided to removes instead of compensating these missing values.

There was many features that have the wrong datatype that needed to be fixed before the analysis. the birth year was replace with the age that is is easily readable.I have also transformed the duration that was in seconds to minutes for convinience
